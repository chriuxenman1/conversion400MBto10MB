# conversion400MBto10MB
It is problematic to work with large excel files. In this case one file has a data-volume of 50 MB (in total 400 MB).
On the other hand only a short amount of this data is necessary. In fact, this script was created to reduce the file size from 400 MB to easy applicable 10 MB.
The data-volume is reduced by 60% and could be achieved with a short and simple script:
1. Extract the relevant data out of 8 same formatted excel files which are located in the same folder.
2. Reshape the data and summarize it into one lean csv file.
3. Save the data in a csv file.
